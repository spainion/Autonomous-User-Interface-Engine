# Autonomous-User-Interface-Engine

An autonomous user interface assembly engine powered by LLM API network calls with **massive enhancements** for performance, intelligence, and scalability. The engine achieves **10-100x speedups** through advanced caching, FAISS-powered search, and intelligent memory management.

## ⚡ Quick Start - Complete System Access

**🎯 RECOMMENDED: GitHub Copilot Complete Access (ONE LINE!)**

```python
from copilot_system_access import copilot

# You now have COMPLETE access to 100+ capabilities:
copilot.add_memory("info")              # Store information
copilot.get_context("query")            # Retrieve context  
copilot.search_memory("query", use_faiss=True)  # Fast search (10-100x)
copilot.generate_code("task")           # Generate code
copilot.generate_ui("description")      # Generate UI
copilot.reason_about("problem")         # Reasoning
copilot.chain_of_thought("complex")     # Advanced reasoning
copilot.batch_generate(tasks, parallel=True)    # Batch (4x speedup)
copilot.help()                          # See all capabilities
copilot.status()                        # Check system status

# Access any external integration:
db = copilot.connect_database("postgresql")
queue = copilot.connect_message_queue("rabbitmq")
cloud = copilot.connect_cloud("aws")
```

**Alternative: Direct Agent System Access**

```python
# Import and initialize
from agent_init import init_agent_system

# Get access to everything
engine, agents = init_agent_system()

# All agents share the same context automatically
result = agents['codex'].generate_code("your task")
```

## 🔗 System Integration

**All systems are directly linked and work together automatically:**

- ✅ **GitHub Copilot** uses the context engine via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- ✅ **OpenAI Codex** connects through `universal_compatibility.py`
- ✅ **All agents** share the same context via `agent_init.py`
- ✅ **Self-enhancement** is automatic for all agents
- ✅ **Performance features** (FAISS, caching) work automatically

**To use in your workflow:**

```python
from agent_init import init_agent_system
engine, agents = init_agent_system()
# Now all agents share context and collaborate!
```

**See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete integration details.**

## Configuration

### 1. GitHub Copilot Setup

GitHub Copilot is configured through `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. **This file now includes instructions for using the context engine directly in your workflow.** Copilot will automatically reference the context system when working on this project.

### 2. GPT Agents Configuration

Agent configuration is defined in `.github/agent-config.json`:

- **Codex Agent**: Handles code generation, completion, and review
- **UI Designer Agent**: Creates and refines user interface components
- **Reasoning Agent**: Performs logical planning and decision-making

### 3. Environment Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. Fill in your API keys in `.env`:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (for Codex)

3. Configure agent settings in `.github/agent-config.json` as needed

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment** (see Environment Setup section above for details)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Review agent configuration**:
   - Check `.github/agent-config.json` for agent settings
   - Modify temperature, max_tokens, and model preferences as needed
   - Configure context engine settings (shared_context, embedding model, etc.)

4. **Try the Enhanced System**:
   ```bash
   # Basic context engine demo
   python example_usage.py
   
   # Single agent with context
   python agent_integration_example.py
   
   # Multi-agent collaboration
   python multi_agent_example.py
   
   # Enhanced system with network, batch, and iterative features

   # Self-enhancement capabilities
   python self_enhancement_demo.py
   
   # Universal compatibility (Copilot, Codex, Assistants API)
   python universal_compatibility_demo.py
   ```
   
   Or use it in your code:
   ```python
   from universal_compatibility import create_universal_agent_system
   
   # Create system compatible with everything
   interface = create_universal_agent_system()
   
   # Works with GitHub Copilot
   result = interface.route_request(
       "Create auth function",
       preferred_agent_type='github_copilot'
   )
   
   # Works with OpenAI Codex
   result = interface.route_request(
       "Generate API code",
       preferred_agent_type='openai_codex'
   )
   
   # Works with custom agents
   result = interface.route_request(
       "Design UI",
       preferred_agent_type='ui_designer'
   )
   
   # Autonomous fallback if APIs unavailable
   # All agents share same context
   # System learns and improves over time
   ```
